The Computing Language Utility (CLU) is a lightweight API designed to help programmers explore, learn, and rapidly prototype programs with OpenCL.  This API reduces the complexity associated with initializing OpenCL devices, contexts, kernels and parameters, etc. while preserving the ability to drop down to the lower level OpenCL API at will when programmers wants to get their hands dirty. The CLU release includes an open source implementation along with documentation and samples that demonstrate how to use CLU in real applications.  It has been tested on Windows 7 with Visual Studio  and OS X.
